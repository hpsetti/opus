The benefit of describing use errors with this level of detail is that it makes it easier to envision the right risk mitigations, which might differ for different use errors. For example, the risk mitigation for “not fully inserting the test strip” might be an alert indicating when the test strip is only partially inserted. In contrast, the risk mitigation for “inserting the test strip backwards” might be printing an arrow on the test strip to indicate which end the user should insert into the meter.",

The benefit of describing use errors with this level of detail is that it makes it easier to envision the right risk mitigations, which might differ for different use errors. For example, the risk mitigation for “not fully inserting the test strip” might be an alert indicating when the test strip is only partially inserted. In contrast, the risk mitigation for “inserting the test strip backwards” might be printing an arrow on the test strip to indicate which end the user should insert into the meter.",
